# DevOps Pipeline Implementation Plan for Task10_2D - Jenkins & Terraform Integration

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of a comprehensive DevOps pipeline for the Task10_2D repository, a microservices e-commerce application deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The solution integrates Jenkins pipelines with Terraform/OpenTofu for infrastructure as code, while maintaining GitHub integration for triggering. The pipeline includes staging (temporary) and production (persistent) environments with automated testing, deployment, and rollback capabilities.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure as Code Setup (Terraform/OpenTofu)
- Create Terraform configuration for Azure infrastructure
- Configure Azure Resource Group, ACR, and AKS resources
- Set up environment-specific variable files (staging.tfvars, production.tfvars)
- Implement remote state management for production use
- Add monitoring and logging components (Log Analytics, Application Insights)

### Phase 2: Jenkins Pipeline Development
- Create CI pipeline (Jenkinsfile.ci) for testing branch
  - Automated testing for all backend services
  - Infrastructure provisioning with Terraform
  - Docker image building and pushing to ACR
- Create CD staging pipeline (Jenkinsfile.cd-staging)
  - Deploy to temporary staging environment
  - Automated health checks and testing
  - Automatic cleanup after testing window
- Create CD production pipeline (Jenkinsfile.cd-production)
  - Deploy to persistent production environment
  - Backup and rollback capabilities
  - Blue-green and rolling deployment strategies

### Phase 3: GitHub-Jenkins Integration
- Implement GitHub Actions workflows to trigger Jenkins pipelines
- Configure webhook-based and API-based triggering
- Maintain GitHub security and access control
- Enable manual pipeline triggering with parameters

### Phase 4: Monitoring and Security
- Integrate Azure Application Insights for application monitoring
- Configure automated rollback on health check failures
- Implement security scanning in pipelines
- Set up notification systems for deployment status

## Technical Details

### Tools and Technologies
- **CI/CD Platform**: Jenkins (with GitHub integration for triggering)
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform/OpenTofu for Azure resource provisioning
- **Containerization**: Docker (existing Dockerfiles)
- **Registry**: Azure Container Registry (ACR) for storing images
- **Orchestration**: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with existing Kubernetes manifests
- **Secrets Management**: Jenkins Credential Store with Azure Service Principal authentication
- **Monitoring**: Azure Application Insights and Log Analytics for metrics and logs
- **Security**: Azure role-based access control, container vulnerability scanning

### Architecture Overview
```
GitHub Repository (Code) 
    ↓ (webhook/API trigger)
Jenkins Server (Pipeline Execution)
    ↓ (provisions infrastructure)
Terraform/OpenTofu (Infrastructure as Code)
    ↓ (creates resources)
Azure Resources (ACR, AKS, Log Analytics)
    ↓ (deploys applications)
Kubernetes Cluster (Application Runtime)
```

### Pipeline Structure
- **Jenkins CI Pipeline (testing branch)**:
  - Jobs: Test, Infrastructure Setup, Build & Push
  - Test: Run pytest on backend services with PostgreSQL containers
  - Infrastructure: Deploy/update Azure resources via Terraform
  - Build: Docker build for each service, tag with build number
  - Push: Upload to ACR with proper tagging
  
- **Jenkins CD Staging Pipeline**:
  - Jobs: Deploy, Test, Cleanup
  - Deploy: Create temporary AKS deployments, configure LoadBalancers
  - Test: Automated health checks and manual testing window
  - Cleanup: Destroy staging resources automatically
  
- **Jenkins CD Production Pipeline**:
  - Jobs: Backup, Deploy, Monitor, Rollback
  - Backup: Save current deployment state for rollback
  - Deploy: Rolling or blue-green deployment to production AKS
  - Monitor: Health checking with automatic rollback on failure
  - Rollback: Manual or automatic rollback capabilities

### Best Practices Incorporated
- Infrastructure as Code with version control
- Immutable infrastructure deployments
- Automated testing at multiple levels
- Security scanning and vulnerability assessment
- Proper secret management and credential handling
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Disaster recovery and rollback procedures
- Environment-specific configuration management

## Testing Steps

### Unit Testing

### Integration Testing
- In pipeline: Test API endpoints (e.g., product creation, order placement) against local Docker containers.
- Verify RabbitMQ message publishing/consuming.

### Acceptance Testing (Staging)
- Manual: Access frontend, add product, place order, check status updates.
- Trivial: API health checks, database connectivity.

### Production Testing
- Post-deployment: Automated smoke tests (e.g., via GitHub Actions), monitor Application Insights for errors.
- Rollback: If failures detected, redeploy previous image tag.
